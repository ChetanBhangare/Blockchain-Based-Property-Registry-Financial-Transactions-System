    Technology: AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol with AccessControl (BUYER_SELLER_ROLE), event logging (PropertyListedForSale), MongoDB for off-chain listing status.

Buy Property:
    Operation: Purchase a listed property by sending ETH.
    User: Buyer (Buyer/Seller role, via buyProperty).
    Data: Token ID, payment amount (ETH), buyer address.
    Approval: None (automatic upon sufficient payment).
    Technology: AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol with ReentrancyGuard, Chainlink Oracle for price validation, ERC721 ownership transfer, event logging (PropertySold), MongoDB for off-chain purchase data, Web3 client (MetaMask) for transaction confirmation.

Update Property Price:
    Operation: Update a property’s price based on market data.
    User: Development Authority (via updatePropertyPrice).
    Data: Token ID, new price (in ETH), Oracle price feed data.
    Approval: None (Development Authority only).
    Technology: AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol with AccessControl (DEVELOPMENT_AUTHORITY), Chainlink Oracle (AggregatorV3Interface), event logging (PriceUpdated), MongoDB for off-chain price tracking.

Check Property Compliance:
    Operation: Verify property compliance with external standards (e.g., zoning laws).
    User: Any user (via checkCompliance).
    Data: Token ID, Oracle compliance data.
    Approval: None (public view function).
    Technology: AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol with Chainlink Oracle, MongoDB for off-chain compliance data.

Retrieve Property Information:
    Operation: Fetch property details (on-chain and off-chain).
    User: Any user (via getProperty, frontend queries to MongoDB).
    Data: Property address, location, floors, price, sale status, type, approvers, required approvals, token ID, off-chain metadata (e.g., images).
    Approval: None (public view function).
    Technology: AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol with getProperty, MongoDB queries via Express.js, Vue.js/React.js frontend.

Manage User Roles:
    Operation: Grant or revoke roles (Development Authority, Approver, Buyer/Seller).
    User: Development Authority (via grantRole).
    Data: Role (bytes32), account address.
    Approval: None (Development Authority only).
    Technology: AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol with AccessControl.


Menus (Frontend Navigation)
    Property Listing Menu: Displays all registered properties (on-chain token IDs, off-chain MongoDB data).
    Register Property Menu: Allows Development Authority to register new properties (requires MetaMask authentication, role check).
    Transfer Request Menu: Enables owners to create transfer requests and approvers to approve them.
    List Property for Sale Menu: Allows owners to list properties for sale with a price.
    Buy Property Menu: Enables buyers to purchase listed properties via Web3 (MetaMask).
    Compliance Check Menu: Displays property compliance status (via Oracle).
    User Management Menu: Allows Development Authority to manage roles (optional, admin interface).


Data (On-Chain and Off-Chain)
On-Chain Data (Smart Contract):
    Property: address, location, floors, price, forSale, approvers, requiredApprovals, propertyType, additionalDetails.
    TransferRequest: tokenId, from, to, approvalCount, isActive, hasApproved.
    Token IDs, ownership (ERC721), events (e.g., PropertyRegistered, PropertySold).


Off-Chain Data (MongoDB):
    Property metadata: images, detailed location data, historical transactions, compliance documents.
    User profiles: roles, transaction history, preferences.
    Market data: Oracle-derived prices, compliance updates.
    Approvals (Role-Based and Multi-Signature)


Role-Based Approvals (Access Control):
    Development Authority: Registers properties, manages roles, updates prices.
    Approvers: Approves transfer requests.
    Buyers/Sellers: Initiates transfers, lists/buys properties.

Multi-Signature Approvals:
    Property transfers require requiredApprovals from designated approvers before execution.
    Technology Features
    Smart Contract (AdvancedPropertyRegistry.sol):
    ERC721 for NFT-based properties, OpenZeppelin AccessControl for roles, ReentrancyGuard for security, Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface for Oracle data.

Backend (Express.js, MongoDB):
    CRUD operations for property metadata, user data, and market data via REST API, CORS for frontend integration.
    Frontend (Vue.js/React.js):
    Web3 integration (Ethers.js/Web3.js) for smart contract interactions, Axios for backend communication, user-friendly navigation (Vue Router/React Router).

Chainlink Oracle:
    Fetches real-time property prices, compliance data, or market trends (e.g., ETH/USD, zoning laws).

Dockerization:
    Containers for frontend, backend, MongoDB, and Chainlink Oracle (if local), orchestrated via Docker Compose.

Web3 Application:
    Demonstrates client purchase (e.g., MetaMask transaction for buyProperty), ownership transfer verification, and MongoDB updates.
